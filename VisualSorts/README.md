# Visual Sorts
Visual Sorts is a windows desktop application that allows a user to see a visual representation of many common sorting algorithms. It utilizes the [Sorts: Abstracted](https://github.com/kshannoninnes/SortsAbstracted) library to perform the sorting, and [OxyPlot](https://github.com/oxyplot/oxyplot) to display the algorithms visually.

### Todo
- Add ability for user to change the pre-sorted data ordering (Ordered, Randomized, Reversed)
- Add metrics to show performance of different algorithms
